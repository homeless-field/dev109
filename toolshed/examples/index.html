    <h1 id="top">The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about
        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
        of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
        the other scientific journals her work had
        appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>
            On
            The Road
        </cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be
        free.
    </p>
    <p>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>
            Work is the refuge of
            people who have nothing better to do
        </q>. Although
        many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
        the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
        outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
        she had something better to do.

    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>
        Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a
        recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium
            heat
        </li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl </li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
        <li>
            Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
            the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
            you are making an omelette)
        </li>
        <li>
            When the eggs are still moist remove from the
            heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
            until served)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Forms -->
    <h1>Forms</h1>
    <p>
        Forms require an action attribute, a URL that information will be sent to when the form is submitted.
        They also need a method attribute. In a get method, information will be added directly to the action URL. This is insecure and inefficient for large data.
        In a post method, information is sent in an HTTP header. This is more secure and allows large data.
